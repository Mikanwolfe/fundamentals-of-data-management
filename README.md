# Fundamentals of Data Management

**COS20015 | 2019 HS2 Hawthorn**

---

Though not a direct successor to *Creating Web Applications*, Fundamentals of Data Management is akin to an introductory unit into utilising Linux and computer science techniques to design and manage data storage applications (databases).

Notably, the unit covers:

* Regex
* JSON and XML formats and queries
* Normalisation
* SQL and MySQL
  * Creating tables and queries
* Isolation Levels
* Concurrency
* A bit of NoSQL

Though most of the course is expected to be completed in a provided VM, I personally utilised Oracle's VirtualBox and Ubuntu 19.01 along with Windows MySQL Workbench 8.0 on a Windows 10 machine to complete all the tasks.

Furthermore, for the distinction and high-distinction requirements:

### Distinction

Design and implement a database with accompanying data. The database chosen was a basic [*Kantai Collection*](https://en.kancollewiki.net/Kancolle_Wiki) database containing ship information, nations, and equipment.  This can be found in the [d-task](https://github.com/Mikanwolfe/fundamentals-of-data-management/tree/master/d-task) folder.

### High Distinction

Research and report on an advanced database topic. the topic chosen was a comparison of NoSQL to MySQL from the standpoint of existing issues within the SQL framework and how NoSQL combats those challenges. The report itself can be found in the [hd-task](https://github.com/Mikanwolfe/fundamentals-of-data-management/tree/master/hd-task) folder.

#### A Note on this Repository

Yes, this repository contains all the "answers" to this unit. No, I won't help nor respond to any requests for help. If you're studying at a University, check out all the resources available to you. If you're from Swin-U in particular, check out ATC620: the Programming Help Desk; make sure you go at odd times (think 4/5pm) for the best help.

A friendly reminder that plagiarism is a thing, even with programming. Feel free to have a look if you're stuck, but if you don't understand it, you're doing it wrong. I don't want to pull this repository simply because one person did something silly; I stand by the idea that all information should be readily accessible, though some more than others.
