Below is a screenshot of the e`grep` command used on `IPaddresses.txt`

Running `egrep` on `access.log` returns 967 results:

The command used is `^((25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|1?[0-9]?[0-9])\.){3}(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|1?[0-9]?[0-9])\b`

Breaking it down:

* `^` implies that the search must start at a new line (and therefore a new entry)
* `(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|1?[0-9]?[0-9])\.` breaks down into:
  * `250-255 OR 200-249 OR 0-199` and then a full-stop `.`
* `{3}` implies that the above should be run three times exactly, as IP addresses are 0-255.0-255.0-255.0-255
* `(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|1?[0-9]?[0-9])` repeats such that the full-stop is **not** captured
* `\b`ensures that there is a word break and therefore, there are no additional characters.
