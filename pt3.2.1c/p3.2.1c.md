The ERD above describes the movie system through the use of weak entities to connect many-to-many relationships. 

All IDs are primary keys.

### Weak Entities and the -List suffix

Consider the following:

```
A movie may have multiple genres.
Therefore, a movie has multiple records on the genre list:

Table: Genre List (GL)
+------------------+--------------------+
| Movie ID (Movie) | Genre ID (Genre)   |
+------------------+--------------------+
| IT               | Horror             |
+------------------+--------------------+
| IT               | Supernatural       |
+------------------+--------------------+

The GL Table only contains linking records between the Movie and the Genre

```

The same idea applies to all the four different "Many to Many" relationships seen in the scenario, specifically, for **Actors**, **Directors**, **Production Companies**, and for **Genres**.

In the case of Actors and the Actor List, each Actor List (a connection between an actor and a specific movie) may contain a sub-container for quotes, sort of like a nested version of the above Weak Entity.
