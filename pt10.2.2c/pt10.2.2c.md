Analysing the tables gives us:

![1571797185320](F:\repos\fundamentals-of-data-management\pt10.2.2c\pt10.2.2c.assets\1571797185320.png)

A success.

Rebuilding the database and running:

```mysql
EXPLAIN EXTENDED
SELECT * FROM Orders NATURAL JOIN Order_Details WHERE
QuotedPrice > 1000 AND OrderDate BETWEEN '2012-10-01'
AND '2012-10-31';
```

gives:

![1571797633255](F:\repos\fundamentals-of-data-management\pt10.2.2c\pt10.2.2c.assets\1571797633255.png)

running:

```mysql
Analyze table Orders; 
Analyze table Order_Details;
```

And then running the explain-extended gives:

![1571797671613](F:\repos\fundamentals-of-data-management\pt10.2.2c\pt10.2.2c.assets\1571797671613.png)



## An Explanation of 'Analyse'

Unfortunately there were no major changes to the table, however, this is somewhat expected as MySQL should analyse the table. 

Analysing a table looks at the statistical key distribution of the table to increase the cardinality of the system. Cardinality refers to the uniqueness of the tuples within the dataset. If cardinality is too high, there are too many unique indexes. On the other hand, if it is too low, the same issue occurs. By statistically analysing the key distribution of the system and assigning various cardinalities, it can potentially optimise any searches of the system.
