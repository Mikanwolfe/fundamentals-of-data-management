**Past Task 3.1.4**

Movie Rental Subtask:

**a)** The Varchar data type would work best for the `Title` column as varchar takes up less space than char under most circumstances. This is useful as it reduces the size of large databases, however, it may cause fragmentation issues if the varchar value were to change (in this case, the movie title changing.) 

â€‹	**Movie Titles Don't Change!** -- Varchar is better.

**b)** A good primary key would be the Item_Number as it is shorter and reduces the chance of conflicts as two movies would have the same name, though a more useful primary key would be a movie rental receipt ID.

* Shorter (faster search)
* Less likely to have input errors (especially due to spelling compared to names)
