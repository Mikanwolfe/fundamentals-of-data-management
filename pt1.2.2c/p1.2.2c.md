The command used is `egrep '"[^"]*Linux.*)[^"]*"' access.log`, though `egrep '"[^"]*Linux[^"]*"' access.log` should work as well

**Edit: Reposted showing the command line**

Breaking down the command gives us:

* `''` is used to isolate the command since we'll be searching for `"` commands
* `" ... " `ensures that our search must be within quotation (`"`) marks
* `[^"]*` on either side of `Linux` ensures that there is only one pair of quotation marks by allowing *everything but `"`*, hence, we only have one pair of quotation marks
* `Linux`, as we are searching for Linux. the `)` is unneeded.
