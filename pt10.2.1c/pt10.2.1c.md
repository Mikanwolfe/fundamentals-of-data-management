* Given the Cardinality of the system is 944, similar to the first row in the `EXPLAIN EXTENDED`, it shows us that the orders were associated with Order_Details based on the primary key. 
  * This means that the DBMS goes  through each OrderNumber (as that is the key used) to find which are from October

* From those rows, the DBMS then searches for the ones over 1000, returning 4 rows.
